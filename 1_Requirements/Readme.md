• When it comes to fitness and health, there are only few basic fundamental parameters to look for like height, weight, diet, etc. However, there’re indices based on these factors which shows the fitness quality of a person. These indices are Body mass Index (BMI), Basal metabolic rate (BMR), Fat percentage, and so on.

• This project aims to calculate the above-mentioned indices of a person and give out the fitness check of the person. The person has to input the basic details of height, weight which will be processed to give output.



## RESEARCH

### Why is maintaining fitness important?

• Save money: With medical treatment getting expensive and unaffordable for a common man, staying healthy not only saves your hard-earned money but also leads to a happier life and wellness.

• Increase your life expectancy: Numerous studies have shown that regular physical activity increases life expectancy and reduces the risk of premature mortality. There’s not a magic formula that translates hours of physical activity into hours of life gained, but research suggests that people who are more active tend to be healthier and tend to live longer.

• Reduce your risk of injury: Regular exercise and physical activity increase muscle strength, bone density, flexibility, and stability. Physical fitness can reduce your risk for and resilience to accidental injuries, especially as you get older. For example, stronger muscles and better balance mean that you’re less likely to slip and fall, and stronger bones mean that you’re less likely to suffer bone injuries should you take a tumble.

## FEATURES

• The person will be giving certain details such as name, age, height, weight, etc. required for the calculation of the fitness indices.

• The person will be then giving an input as to which index the person wishes to see for himself.

• As per the input, corresponding function will be called by the code, and the function will be processing all the input data and the output will be printed accordingly.

• Thus, this project is a handy tool where person simply gives input and output will be given within no time!

## Defining Our System

• The project is aimed towards calculating the health and fitness indices such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal metabolic rate (BMR), Fat percentage. These are very crucial indices which determine the person’s everyday being and fitness quality.

• Thereby, this project is a handy tool where the person has to simply give out basic details which will be processed and the output will be given with a report.

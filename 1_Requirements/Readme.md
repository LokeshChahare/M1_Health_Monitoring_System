# REQUIREMENTS


## INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE

• In these recent times of pandemic Fitness and Health has become an inevitable component for survival. It is of utmost importance for people to maintain good physical health and immunity for fighting off the deadly pathogens.

• When it comes to fitness and health, there are only few basic fundamental parameters to look for like height, weight, diet, etc. However, there’re indices based on these factors which shows the fitness quality of a person. These indices are Body mass Index (BMI), Basal metabolic rate (BMR), Fat percentage, and so on.

• This project aims to calculate the above-mentioned indices of a person and give out the fitness check of the person. The person has to input the basic details of height, weight which will be processed to give output.



## RESEARCH

### Why is maintaining fitness important?

• Save money: With medical treatment getting expensive and unaffordable for a common man, staying healthy not only saves your hard-earned money but also leads to a happier life and wellness.

• Increase your life expectancy: Numerous studies have shown that regular physical activity increases life expectancy and reduces the risk of premature mortality. There’s not a magic formula that translates hours of physical activity into hours of life gained, but research suggests that people who are more active tend to be healthier and tend to live longer.

• Reduce your risk of injury: Regular exercise and physical activity increase muscle strength, bone density, flexibility, and stability. Physical fitness can reduce your risk for and resilience to accidental injuries, especially as you get older. For example, stronger muscles and better balance mean that you’re less likely to slip and fall, and stronger bones mean that you’re less likely to suffer bone injuries should you take a tumble.

## FEATURES

• The person will be giving certain details such as name, age, height, weight, etc. required for the calculation of the fitness indices.

• The person will be then giving an input as to which index the person wishes to see for himself.

• As per the input, corresponding function will be called by the code, and the function will be processing all the input data and the output will be printed accordingly.

• Thus, this project is a handy tool where person simply gives input and output will be given within no time!

## Defining Our System

• The project is aimed towards calculating the health and fitness indices such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal metabolic rate (BMR), Fat percentage. These are very crucial indices which determine the person’s everyday being and fitness quality.

• Thereby, this project is a handy tool where the person has to simply give out basic details which will be processed and the output will be given with a report.

## 4W & 1H

### Who
The project is accessible for everyone. A person has to simply input his basic details such as height, weight, etc. for getting the output.

### What
Upon receiving the inputs, the parameters will be processed and the index person wishes to see will be given as output.

### When
With increased environmental problems, focus has been on improving immunity and fitness level to survive the harsh environmental conditions such as pollutions, infections, and deadly pathogens. Thus, with more and more focus into health and fitness, people are motivated to work towards and it for a heathier lifestyle.

### Where
Only a device supporting the applicated will be required for giving in the inputs and getting the desired output.

### How
The code will be implemented with functions which will be called as per the index person wishes to see, and the function will be processing the input data given by the person. The output will be then printed giving the health check of the person.

## High Level Requirements

| ID   | Description | Category | Status |
| --   | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| HR01 | User shall be able to give inputs | Techincal | Implemented |

## Low Level Requirements
| ID | Description | HLR ID | Status  (Implemented/ Future)|
| -- | ----------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| LR01 | The system will be asking for few details such as age, name, height, weight as input which the user should be able to give	| HR01 | Implemented |
| LR02 | Upon giving the input from the user, the user has to select one or more indices he wishes to see | HR02	| Implemented |
| LR03 | User will be given three option for choosing which index is to be evaluated. 1 for BMI, 2 for BMR and 3 for Fat percentage (switch cases will be used accordingly to call the function) | HR02 |	Implemented |
| LR04 | Receiving the input, the system must call the appropriate function which will process the inputs and give the desired output| HR02 |	Implemented |
| LR05 | More fitness indices can be incorporated for making it a wholesome fitness index kit |	HR02 | Future |
